## Development

### Formatting and Linting

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Format HTML and JavaScript files:

```bash
npm run format
```

Lint JavaScript files:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Naming Conventions

All directories and files use **kebab-case** (lowercase words separated by hyphens).
This keeps URLs consistent and easy to read.
